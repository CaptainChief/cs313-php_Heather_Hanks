      I am in my final semester for college. I plan on working at Boeing when <br>
      I graduate in April. I have had the opportunity to intern for them for <br>
      several years now and am excited to work for them on a more permanent <br>
      basis. <br><br><br>

      I am from Oklahoma, and have a family of fourteen.
